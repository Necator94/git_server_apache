Docker build of git https server based on apache.
This is test building of git server. Apache configured by adding of my_host.conf config file to directory /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. This config file has configurations (paths to ssl sertificats, password file and git repositories which are located in shared with container host directory) only for my case.
